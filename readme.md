IMPORTANT NOTE: for better visual effect, it is recommended to use the "Full Width Template" on the page where the Shortcode is inserted.

### Why a plugin and not a theme?

Because with a plugin and consequently a Shortcode it becomes easier and more flexible to use the output (Hubspor form, in this case) to add it in several different places: pages, posts, CPT, Page Builders (Elementor e.g.).
